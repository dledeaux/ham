This project contains two files.  

One for a remote faceplate mount that gives you a downward angled view towards the driver.  This is helpful when you have an overhead mount in a Jeep like the Arizona Rocky Road bar.

The other is a replacement transceiver mount that allows mounting a device on top.  In my case, I used it for mounting a diplexer on top.
